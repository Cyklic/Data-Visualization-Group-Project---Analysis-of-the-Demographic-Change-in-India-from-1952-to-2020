Analysis-of-the-Demographic-Change-in-India-from-1952-to-2020

Completed on 13th December, 2024


This project investigates India’s demographic changes from 1952 to 2020, focusing on population growth, gender balance, migration trends, age distribution and mortality rates. The goal is to reveal the historical shifts in India's demographics and their implications for future development.
This project provides a detailed analysis of India’s demographic changes from 1952 to 2020 using key data metrics, including population size, age distribution, gender ratio, mortality rates, and migration trends. 
This analysis will shed light on how India’s demographic structure has evolved over seven decades, helping to understand shifts in population density, age demographics, and gender ratios and offering a historical perspective on the country's demographic dynamics.


Objectives and Goals

Track Population Growth Trends: Analyze changes in the total population, including male and female populations, across the years.

Examine Age Distribution and Aging Trends: Study shifts in median age and age distribution to understand the changing structure of India’s population and potential impacts on future generational dynamics.

Assess Gender Balance and Sex Ratio: Analyze changes in the population’s gender ratio to observe any demographic imbalances and their potential social and economic implications.

Analyze Mortality Rates Across Age Groups: Examine mortality data across various age groups to identify patterns in life expectancy, health risks, and improvements in mortality rates over time.

Evaluate Migration Patterns and Impact: Study net migration trends and their impact on India’s demographic composition, particularly the effect of migration on population density and distribution.


I was the team lead for this project and my main task was data exploration, cleaning and transformation. I also assisted in what to add in the Power Bi Dashboard.
